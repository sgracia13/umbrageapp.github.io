# WHAT IS DIBS?!
<b>Umbrage as a studio will be moving into a new office space as most of you know already. <br>
One of the issues that has constantly been a pain point in the current space has been <br>
scheduling time to utilize conference rooms and conflicts around planning for room usage. <br>
As a group, we have been tasked with coming up with a solution to figuring out how to best <br>
address this issue. More specifically, we are building out a software solution that will <br>
give a user the ability to book a time slot for one of four rooms in the new upstairs space. <br>
Dibs, the name of the software we have started to build, will integrate easily with google <br>
calendar and give a user the ability to book a room in the Dibs application and have it <br>
  show up as an event in google calendar. </b>
