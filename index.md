# We wanted everyone in the studio to see what we're up to so we thought we'd make an all inclusive page to give you a bird's eye view. Enjoy!

<details><summary>WHAT IS DIBS?!</summary>
<b>Umbrage as a studio will be moving into a new office space as most of you know already. <br>
One of the issues that has constantly been a pain point in the current space has been <br>
scheduling time to utilize conference rooms and conflicts around planning for room usage. <br>
As a group, we have been tasked with coming up with a solution to figuring out how to best <br>
address this issue. More specifically, we are building out a software solution that will <br>
give a user the ability to book a time slot for one of four rooms in the new upstairs space. <br>
Dibs, the name of the software we have started to build, will integrate easily with google <br>
calendar and give a user the ability to book a room in the Dibs application and have it <br>
  show up as an event in google calendar. </b>

    <td>Sprint one has come to a close and was an overall success. The sprint Demo yesterday received positive <br>
      feedback and was well recepted. Today, we went through our first formal sprint planning as a team with <br>
      the common goal of making sure that the work items in Sprint two were going to be manageable to complete. <br>
      Looking at what was carried over from sprint one (only two work items that are planning to be completed <br>
      today) it seems that the devs are well on their way to being successful and productive for Sprint two. <br>
      Yesterday, we also got the opportunity to sit down and have a retro for sprint one where we reflected <br>
      on things we could definitely improve on and would strengthen our relationship as a team for sprint two. <br>
      One takeaway was that more time was needed to be put on the calendar for the developers and design team <br>
      to sync up and ask open ended questions throughout the implementation and development process. Using <br>
      the retro to align on new initiatives was really eye-opening and we quickly saw that as a team, we <br>
      share many of the same opinions and concerns. Below is a screen shot from our miro board and two <br>
      recurring themes that came up in our retro exercise. We look forward to successful kick-off to <br>
      sprint two.

    <td>Two days left in sprint one and things are starting to really pick up with the Dibs project. Uly and Colton <br>
have been hard at work with implementing the login functionality. The look of the login page and authentication <br>
flow is simple and easy to follow and has been coming together with very few hiccups. Daniel and Aivory have really <br>
stretched their design abilities and knocked it out of the park when it came to the design of the login page UI and <br>
contributed a massive amount to the authentication app flow. The devs are well on their way to completing all planned <br>
user stories and tasks. Below is a burndown chart that shows just how well Colton and Uly have been pacing themselves <br>
through this sprint. The grey line indicates the ideal pace or completion rate compared to outstanding work still left <br>
to complete. We plan to have a demo of what we have completed thus far on Tuesday of next week 5/3/2022. Everyone is <br>
welcome to join to check out what we accomplished for our first sprint! <br>
