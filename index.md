# We wanted everyone in the studio to see what we're up to so we thought we'd make an all inclusive page to give you a bird's eye view. Enjoy!

<details><summary>WHAT IS DIBS?!</summary>
<b>Umbrage as a studio will be moving into a new office space as most of you know already. <br>
One of the issues that has constantly been a pain point in the current space has been <br>
scheduling time to utilize conference rooms and conflicts around planning for room usage. <br>
As a group, we have been tasked with coming up with a solution to figuring out how to best <br>
address this issue. More specifically, we are building out a software solution that will <br>
give a user the ability to book a time slot for one of four rooms in the new upstairs space. <br>
Dibs, the name of the software we have started to build, will integrate easily with google <br>
calendar and give a user the ability to book a room in the Dibs application and have it <br>
  show up as an event in google calendar. </b>

    <td>Two days left in sprint one and things are starting to really pick up with the Dibs project. Uly and Colton <br> 
have been hard at work with implementing the login functionality. The look of the login page and authentication <br>
flow is simple and easy to follow and has been coming together with very few hiccups. Daniel and Aivory have really <br>
stretched their design abilities and knocked it out of the park when it came to the design of the login page UI and <br>
contributed a massive amount to the authentication app flow. The devs are well on their way to completing all planned <br>
user stories and tasks. Below is a burndown chart that shows just how well Colton and Uly have been pacing themselves <br>
through this sprint. The grey line indicates the ideal pace or completion rate compared to outstanding work still left <br>
to complete. We plan to have a demo of what we have completed thus far on Tuesday of next week 5/2/2022. Everyone is <br>
welcome to join to check out what we accomplished for our first sprint!</td>
