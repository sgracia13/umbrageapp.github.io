<p> Two days left in sprint one and things are starting to really pick up with the Dibs project. Uly and Colton <br> 
have been hard at work with implementing the login functionality. The look of the login page and authentication <br>
flow is simple and easy to follow and has been coming together with very few hiccups. Daniel and Aivory have really <br>
stretched their design abilities and knocked it out of the park when it came to the design of the login page UI and <br>
contributed a massive amount to the authentication app flow. The devs are well on their way to completing all planned <br>
user stories and tasks. Below is a burndown chart that shows just how well Colton and Uly have been pacing themselves <br>
through this sprint. The grey line indicates the ideal pace or completion rate compared to outstanding work still left <br>
to complete. We plan to have a demo of what we have completed thus far on Tuesday of next week 5/2/2022. Everyone is <br>
welcome to join to check out what we accomplished for our first sprint! </p>
