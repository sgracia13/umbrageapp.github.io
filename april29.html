<h1> Friday April 29th,2022  </h1>

<p> Two days left in sprint one and things are starting to really pick up with the Dibs project. Uly and Colton <br> 
have been hard at work with implementing the login functionality. The look of the login page and authentication <br>
flow is simple and easy to follow and has been coming together with very few hiccups. Daniel and Aivory have really <br>
stretched their design abilities and knocked it out of the park when it came to the design of the login page UI and <br>
contributed a massive amount to the authentication app flow. The devs are well on their way to completing all planned <br>
user stories and tasks. We plan to have a demo of what we have completed on Tuesday of next week 5/2/2022. Everyone is <br>
welcome to join to check out what we accomplished for this first sprint! </p>
